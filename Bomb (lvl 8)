ðŸŽ‰ Kicking off #CADecember 2024 with a *bang*! ðŸ’£  

The first model is hereâ€”Bomb (Level 8) from *Clash of Clans*! Nothing says "STAY OUT" quite like a good old-fashioned hidden bomb. This was a fun and simple start to the challenge, designed in SOLIDWORKS and rendered entirely online using the powerful xStudio app.  

This yearâ€™s theme is all about bringing the *Clash of Clans* universe to life in CAD. Stay tuned for daily designs as I explore creativity, sharpen my skills, and have a blast along the way!
